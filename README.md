About Me

I am the opposite to the urban definition of Tarquin.

http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tarquin

The term used for a pompous little posh boy who strolls around "uni" with wavy hair and wearing a jack wills shirt and a gillet.

Daddy has obviously sent this little weasel to private school and has spoilt him throughout his life.

Looks down to the 'dregs' of society (basically everyone not dressed in jack wills clothing) and turns his nose up at them whilst laughing at what their probable and less unfortunate upbringing was like!
Lad 1: have a look at that bloke over there sucking on a silver spoon and flicking his hair every two seconds

Lad 2: only one word for him mate.....Tarquin!
